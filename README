It's an Outliner, a TODO-list solution, a project management tool, a Business Process Management aid, a data modeler, a Use Case facilitator, a way to describe the human DNA or the history of the universe ;) It can also encrypt your lists and be used as a very structured  password safe.

WOIM is a methodology to describe anything - any state, item(s), pattern, action, process, transition, program, instruction set etc.

This plugin does both highlighting and various automatic handling of WOIM lists, like collapsing lists or parts of lists in a sophisticated way.

The plugin incorporates encryption. You can encrypt any part of a WOIM list or take advantage of the autoencryption feature by making the WOIM list a dot file - i.e. prefixing the file name wiht a dot (such as ".test.woim"). You can use this plugin to make a password safe - it turns off viminfo and swapfiles to ensure security.

INSTRUCTIONS

Use tabs/shifts or * for indentations

Use <SPACE> to toggle one fold
Use \0 to \9, \a, \b, \c, \d, \e, \f to show up to 15 levels expanded

Use <leader>s to remove underlining of States (prefixed with S:)
Use <leader>S to add underlining of States (prefixed with S:)
Use <leader>t to remove underlining of Transitions (prefixed with T:)
Use <leader>T to add underlining of Transitions (prefixed with T:)

Use <leader>v to add a checkbox at start of item or to toggle a checkbox
Use <leader>V to add/toggle a checkbox with a date stamp for completion

Use "gr" (without the quotation marks, signifies "Goto Ref") while the cursor is on a WOIM reference to jump to that destination in a WOIM list. Use "n" after a "gr" to verify that the reference destination is unique.

Use <leader><SPACE> to go to the next open template element
(A template element is a WOIM item ending in an equal sign)

Use <leader>z to encrypt the current line (including all sublevels if folded)
Use <leader>Z to encrypt the current file (all lines)
Use <leader>x to decrypt the current line (mark all subsequent encrypted lines)
Use <leader>X to decrypt the current file (all lines)

If you want a WOIM list to be automatically encrypted upon saving and decrypted upon opening it, just prefix the filename with a dot (like ".test.woim").

When using encryption in a WOIM list or for the whole file, you will be asked for a password - twice when saving the file and once when opening it. You must have OpenSSL in your path to take advantage of these features.

Syntax updated at start and every time you leave Insert mode
