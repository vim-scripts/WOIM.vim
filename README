It's an Outliner, a TODO-list solution, a project management tool, a Business Process Management aid, a data modeler, a Use Case facilitator, a way to describe the human DNA or the history of the universe ;)

WOIM is a methodology to describe anything - any state, item(s), pattern, action, process, transition, program, instruction set etc.

This plugin does both highlighting and various automatic handling of WOIM lists, like collapsing lists or parts of lists in a sophisticated way.

For information on WOIM, read the WOIM description in full:
