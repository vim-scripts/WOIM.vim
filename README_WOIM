== General instructions for the VIM plugin for WOIM ==

WOIM is a methodology to describe anything - any state, item(s), pattern,
action, process, transition, program, instruction set etc. So, you can use
it as an outliner, a ToDo list handler, a process design tool, a data
modeler, or any other way you want to describe something.

This plugin does both highlighting and various automatic handling of WOIM
lists, like collapsing lists or parts of lists in a sophisticated way.
