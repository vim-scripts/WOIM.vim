GENERAL INFORAMTION ABOUT THE VIM PLUGIN FOR WOIM

WOIM is a methodology to describe anything - any state, item(s), pattern,
action, process, transition, program, instruction set etc. So, you can use
it as an outliner, a ToDo list handler, a process design tool, a data
modeler, or any other way you want to describe something.

This plugin does both highlighting and various automatic handling of WOIM
lists, like collapsing lists or parts of lists in a sophisticated way.

As you most certainly have already done, to install the WOIM plugin for
VIM, dowmload woim.vba and do:

  vim woim.vba
  :so %
  :q

You will then discover that this file (README_WOIM) will appear in the VIM
directory, while the documentation will be placed in the "doc"
subdirectory, the WOIM plugin will be placed in the "syntax" subdirectory.
A WOIM filetype detection file is placed in the "ftdetect" subdirectory.

From now on all files with the ".woim" file extension will be treated as a
WOIM file, syntax highlighted corrrectly and you can use all the neat WOIM
functionality for VIM.

To use WOIM lists within other file types (other than ".woim"), add the
following to those syntax files:

  syn include @WOIM ~/.vim/syntax/woim.vim
  syn region WoimSnip matchgroup=Snip start="WOIMstart" end="WOIMend" contains=@WOIM
  hi link Snip SpecialComment

The documentation file contains all of the WOIM definition and is also found here:
