== Install instructions for the VIM plugin for WOIM ==

As you most certainly have already done:

  vim woim.vba
  :so %
  :q

You will then discover that the files INSTALL_WOIM and README_WOIM appear
in the VIM directory, while the documentation will be placed in the "doc"
subdirectory and most importantly, the WOIM pluging will be placed in teh
"syntax" subdirectory.

Add to your .vimrc file or create a file named "woim.vim" with the
following and drop that file in the "ftdetect" directory:

  au BufRead,BufNewFile *.woim set filetype=woim

To use WOIM lists within other file types (other than ".woim"), add the
following to those syntax files:

  syn include @WOIM ~/.vim/syntax/woim.vim
  syn region WoimSnip matchgroup=Snip start="WOIMstart" end="WOIMend" contains=@WOIM
  hi link Snip SpecialComment

The documentation file contains all of the WOIM definition as found here:
